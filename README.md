# Prolog

Written for Strawberry Prolog (https://dobrev.com/)
Basic excercises in Prolog and a Minesweeper project I have made.

# Possible enchancement

Better colours for the minesweeper

# Side notes

Rather non-standard use of Prolog, doesn't truly utilise its essence.
Nonogram is unfinished. Backbone of the program is done, not the solutions.
